/**
 * Where the dial's controls end up inside a widget of a given size.
 *
 * The widget draws the app's DialView to a square bitmap and shows it with
 * fitCenter, so the dial is centred and its side is the smaller of the two
 * dimensions. These are the same formulas DialView uses, applied to the
 * widget's real size so the invisible tap targets can be placed exactly over
 * the controls that were drawn.
 *
 * Doing this with a fixed grid does not work: the four controls occupy only
 * the middle 45% or so of the dial, so a grid of thirds or quarters puts every
 * one of them in the wrong cell.
